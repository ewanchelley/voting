Level 4 Project to investigate different methods of preference aggregation in voting systems.

Find the deployment of the application at https://ewanchelley.github.io/voting/.

The GitHub repository for the application can be found at https://github.com/ewanchelley/voting.

The source code for the project can be found in the src folder. Wthin the app folder are folders containing all of the components, services and other source files.

## Run Locally

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.9.

### Prerequisites

Node.js and npm must be installed to download the Angular CLI.

Install Angular CLI using `npm install -g @angular/cli`

The node_modules folder had to be removed to reduce the file size below 100MB, so the command `npm install` must be ran before running locally.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.




## Abstract

Many voting rules exist, and each may produce a different ranking of candidates given the
preferences of a set of voters. For those without significant knowledge in the field of voting
theory, it can be difficult to understand the differences between voting rules, and the reasons one
rule may be chosen over another. This project involved the development of a web application to
aid in the learning of voting concepts, and allow users to calculate the outcome of an election
under different voting rules, using their own voting data. The app was evaluated and shown to
be effective as a tool for calculating voting outcomes and as an educational resource.
