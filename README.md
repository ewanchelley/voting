Many voting rules exist, and each may produce a different ranking of candidates given the
preferences of a set of voters. For those without significant knowledge in the field of voting
theory, it can be difficult to understand the differences between voting rules, and the reasons one
rule may be chosen over another. This project involved the development of a web application to
aid in the learning of voting concepts, and allow users to calculate the outcome of an election
under different voting rules, using their own voting data. The app was evaluated and shown to
be effective as a tool for calculating voting outcomes and as an educational resource.
