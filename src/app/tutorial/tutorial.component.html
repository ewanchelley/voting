    <app-tile heading="Candidates, Rankings and Voters">
        In an election, there are multiple candidates. For example an election may have 3 candidates: 
        <hl>Adam</hl>, <hl>Beth</hl> and <hl>Chris</hl>.
        <br><br>
        Each voter produces a ranking, which is their order of preference for the list of candidates.
        For example, if a voter believed <hl>Adam</hl> was the best candidate and
        <hl>Beth</hl> was the worst, their ranking would be <hl>Adam, Chris, Beth</hl>.
    </app-tile>

    <app-tile heading="Voting Aggregation">
        Once all votes have been cast, there is a list of rankings.
        For example, suppose 10 voters ranked the candidates introduced above.
        The list of rankings produced may look like:
        <br><br>
        V1: <hl>Adam, Chris, Beth</hl>
        <br>
        V2: <hl>Chris, Beth, Adam</hl>
        <br>
        V3: <hl>Beth, Adam, Chris</hl>
        <br>
        V4: <hl>Adam, Chris, Beth</hl>
        <br>
        V5: <hl>Adam, Chris, Beth</hl>
        <br>
        V6: <hl>Beth, Adam, Chris</hl>
        <br>
        V7: <hl>Chris, Adam, Beth</hl>
        <br>
        V8: <hl>Adam, Chris, Beth</hl>
        <br>
        V9: <hl>Chris, Adam, Beth</hl>
        <br>
        V10: <hl>Beth, Chris, Adam</hl>
        <br><br>
        So who won the election?
        <br><br>
        The challenge now is to determine the order of the candidates in the final standings, which should reflect the preferences of the voters as a whole.
        This may seem trivial at first, but there are many different algorithms used to accomplish this, each having advantages and disadvantages.

    <app-tile heading="Using this Application">
        This application allows the user to input their own set of rankings and candidates 
        to compare how different preference aggregation algorithms work.
        <br><br>
        Begin by editing the candidates and list of rankings by clicking the <hl bg="blue">Edit Rankings</hl> button on the sidebar.
        Rankings are input as a comma separated list containing each of the candidates names.
        The candidates and rankings can also be imported from a txt file or generated randomly.
        <br><br>
        Once the candidates and rankings have been input, select an algorithm from the sidebar to run.
        Algorithms are run as soon as the page is loaded, using the rankings that the user has input.
