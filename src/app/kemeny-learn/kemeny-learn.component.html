    <app-tile heading="How It Works">
        For a proposed ranking of candidates, the Kemeny score can be calculated by 
        taking the sum of the Kendall distances to each voters ranking list.
        The ranking with minimum Kemeny score is the Kemeny Consensus.

    <app-tile heading="Example">
        Given the candidates: <hl>A</hl>, <hl>B</hl> and <hl>C</hl>
        and the 4 rankings:
        <br><br>
        V1: <app-ranking rankingString="B, A, C"></app-ranking>
        <br>
        V2: <app-ranking rankingString="B, C, A"></app-ranking>
        <br>
        V3: <app-ranking rankingString="B, A, C"></app-ranking>
        <br>
        V4: <app-ranking rankingString="A, C, B"></app-ranking>
        <br><br>
        Consider the ranking <app-ranking rankingString="B, A, C"></app-ranking>,
        <br><br>
        Calculate the Kendall distance from this ranking to each of the voters rankings:
        <br><br>
        D1 = 0, D2 = 1, D3 = 0, D4 = 2
        <br><br>
        Therefore the Kemeny score for <app-ranking rankingString="B, A, C"></app-ranking> is D1 + D2 + D3 + D4 = 3.
        <br><br>
        Calculating the Kemeny score for every possible permutation of the candidates would give the following results:

        <br><br>
        Therefore <app-ranking rankingString="B, A, C"></app-ranking> is the Kemeny Consensus since it minimises the Kemeny score.

    <app-tile heading="Evaluation">
        The Kemeny Consensus method meets many of the desirable criteria for a voting method that other methods do not.
        The method guarantees that if a candidate is preferred by the majority in a head to head against each of the other candidates, then that candidate must win (<lnk link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_winner_criterion">Condorcet criterion</lnk>).
        It also guarantees that if a candidate is ranked first by the majority of candidates, it will win (<lnk link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_criterion">Majority criterion</lnk>).
        <br><br>
        The main disadvantage of the method is that there is no algorithm that can find a solution in <lnk link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Polynomial_time">polynomial time</lnk>.
        On a small numbers of candidates, a solution can usually be found in reasonable time, 
        however the number of permutations that need to be considered is C! where C is the number of candidates,
        meaning that for a large number of candidates a solution cannot be found easily.
